### 📌 Project Overview:

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an IMDb movie dataset using SQL. The goal is to uncover interesting patterns and insights about movies, directors, genres, revenue trends, and ratings through structured queries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).



#### 🗃️ Dataset Information:

The dataset contains information about movies, including the following columns:



* ranking: IMDb rank of the movie
* title: Title of the movie
* release\_year: Year the movie was released
* runtime: Duration of the movie in minutes
* genre: Primary genre of the movie
* ratings: IMDb user rating (out of 10)
* director: Name of the movie's director
* votes: Number of IMDb votes
* gross\_revenue: Total box office revenue (in USD)



#### 🧪 Tools Used:



MySQL Workbench – for writing and executing SQL queries



🔍 Key Explorations \& Queries:



* Top Directors by Average Rating (with minimum 5 movies)
* Top 10 Longest and Shortest Movies
* Runtime Bucketing: Short (<90 mins), Medium (90–120), Long (>120)
* Top 10 Highest Grossing Movies
* Most Popular Genres by Ratings
* Yearly Trends in Ratings and Movie Count



#### 🧠 Key Insights



* Some directors consistently maintain high average ratings.
* Longer movies do not always mean better ratings.
* Genres like \[e.g., Drama, Thriller] tend to score higher on average.
* Movie production boomed in certain decades with mixed rating outcomes.
* Revenue data needed cleaning and standardization before analysis.
